## :wolf: Nymeria
#### A small but functional JavaScript testing framework

###### Built with lots of help from Alcides Queiroz's guide on Medium

**This framework was put together in order to help me better understand how testing wokrs in JavaScript. I Do NOT recommend ANYBODY use Nymeria for testing prodcution code!!**

Now since that's out of the way, *how do you use Nymeria to test your code??*
Well as of now it's a long and complicated process, BUT... Like this:

`npm i @gnarwall19/nymeria`

## CONSIDER THIS: ##

- Make sure your tests folder has an `index.js` file that:
    1. Requires nymeria as a const
    2. Requires your `whatever.test.js` files
    3. Finishes with `nymeria.end()` to run the exit code
- `Whatever.test.js` files need to require `{ guarantee, check, xcheck, group }` as a const from nymeria
- Check out the playground folder on [github](https://github.com/Gnarwall19/nymeria) for some examples!
